            This application allows two Android devices to carry out two-way text chat over
            Bluetooth. It demonstrates all the fundamental Bluetooth API capabilites, such as:
              (1) Scanning for other Bluetooth devices
              (2) Querying the local Bluetooth adapter for paired Bluetooth devices
              (3) Establishing RFCOMM channels/sockets
              (4) Connecting to a remote device
              (5) Transfering data over Bluetooth

The Osmium MIMU22BTP(X) / MIMU22B9P(X) simplifies foot-mounted Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR). It enables superior tracking performance, offers ease of building applications and allows use of a simple interfacing application platform (like Android based phone) for tracking without using any pre-installed infrastructure like GPS, WiFi, Maps etc. It is the packaged version of the Osmium MIMU22BT / MIMU22B9 and is utilized best for rapid prototyping and development of pedestrian navigation solutions. Form factor tailoring and price-performance optimization can be done for larger quantities.
